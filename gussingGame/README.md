# Number Guessing Game Explanation

## Imports
- `import random`: This import is necessary to generate random numbers in the game.
- `import pygame`: Pygame is a library used for handling game-related functionality, such as playing sound effects and background music.

## Initialization
- `pygame.init()`: Initializes the pygame library, which is a prerequisite for using pygame's features.

## Loading Sound Files
- Three sound files are loaded using `pygame.mixer.Sound`:
  - `correct_sound`: This sound effect is played when the player guesses the correct number.
  - `incorrect_sound`: This sound effect is played when the player's guess is incorrect.
  - `background_music`: This sound file contains the background music that plays during the game.

## Sound Functions
- `play_correct_sound()`: This function is defined to play the sound effect associated with a correct guess.
- `play_incorrect_sound()`: This function is defined to play the sound effect associated with an incorrect guess.

## ANSI Escape Codes for Color
- ANSI escape codes are used to add color to text output in the terminal. The following color codes are defined:
  - `RED`: Changes text color to red.
  - `GREEN`: Changes text color to green.
  - `YELLOW`: Changes text color to yellow.
  - `END_COLOR`: Resets the text color to the default.

## `guess_the_number` Function
- This is the core function that implements the number guessing game.
- It takes a `level` parameter, which determines the range of numbers to guess based on the chosen difficulty level (1, 2, or 3).
- Depending on the level, it sets the `max_number` that the player can guess.
- A random `secret_number` within the specified range is generated.
- The player is prompted to enter their guess, and the game continues until the player guesses correctly.
- The number of attempts is counted, and the game provides feedback by indicating whether the guess was too low or too high.
- When the player guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the number of attempts made.
- If the player completes level 3, a special message is displayed to indicate game completion.
- If the player chooses not to continue to the next level, they can opt to exit the game.

## Main Function
- The main part of the code is executed in this section.
- It starts by welcoming the player to the game and playing the background music.
- The player is prompted to choose a game level (1, 2, or 3).
- If the chosen level is invalid, an error message is displayed in red text.
- If a valid level is chosen, the `guess_the_number` function is called to start the game.

## Game Loop
- The game loop ensures that the game continues until the player decides to exit.
- After completing the game, the player is given the option to play the next level or exit the game.
- The background music is stopped when the game ends.

Overall, this code demonstrates the implementation of a simple number guessing game with different difficulty levels, sound effects, and colored text output. The game continues until the player decides to exit or successfully completes all levels.
